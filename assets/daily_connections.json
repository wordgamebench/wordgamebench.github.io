Each category belongs to one of these difficulty levels, and there are no duplicate difficulty levels per game. This means that in each game, there will be one category of each difficulty level: one easy (1), one medium (2), one hard (3), and one very hard (4) category.\\n\\nCategory examples:\\n- fish: bass, flounder, salmon, trout\\n- fire___: ant, drill, island, opal\\n\\nCategories will always be more specific than \\\"5-letter-words\\\", \\\"names\\\" or \\\"verbs\\\".\\n\\nEach puzzle has exactly one solution.

Try to think of different ways to group the words, and use the feedback from the game engine to refine your guesses. If you have already guessed some categories, use the difficulty levels of the remaining categories as a proxy for how tricky they are going to be.\\n- You don't have to keep trying to guess the same category, especially since you have a limited number of attempts.

It is not clean. One connection I can make through my \\\"vague\\\" initial thoughts (start) which didn't yield much is a term containing \\\"substance\\\". Upon further inspection of other words  I had initially disregarded, I can see an elevated word through the relationship of \\\"matrix\\\" with others in which matrix can mean more than a 1999 movie. Since \\\"matrix\\\" seems more like physics (e.g. more than movie), or science (also math matrix), if not video (as even less substance likelihood gaming related which fits less with other 12 words even discounting just solved ground words)), that helps greatly narrow the possibilities that are easier connections between seemingly less related words like \\\"draft\\\", and then a less likely than \\\"trade\\\" (3 syllable import worst fit with yet only known fit so far weight after disregarding gravity). \\nGuess: matrix, substance, trade, weight\", \"refusal\": \"\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"You guessed: matrix, weight, trade, substance.\\nIncorrect guess!

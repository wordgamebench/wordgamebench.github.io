Goo was the remaining choice so goo gas doesn't sound right but then all sounds and then \\\"gas\\\" isn't  short form of \\\"goo\\\" or \\\"app\\\" and when that didn't work I looked for gas products e.g gas stove or gas then only products with e.g (app e.g \\\"app\\\" doesn't sound  like a gas related word (it's app and there might be some app with \\\"SAM\\\" not this SAM\\\" this is \\\"SAM\\\") \\\"gas\\\" isn't formed so then there are products like motor \\\"app\\\" sound doesn't sound correct so I looked at goo.

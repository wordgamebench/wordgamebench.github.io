Invalid guesses include non-valid English words, words that don't have exactly 5 characters, or incorrect output format. If you make too many invalid/incorrect guesses, the game will end prematurely. Therefore, you need to be careful to respect the instructions and provide valid guesses in the correct format to maximize your chances of guessing the target word within the 6 valid attempts allowed.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"[6 remaining attempts] Provide your guess:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"```\\nAnswer:::\\nExplanation: Since I have to start the game without any feedback, I will choose a common five-letter word to maximize the chances of containing useful letters.\\nGuess: s t a r t\\n```\", \"refusal\": \"\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"You guessed: start\\nFollowing is feedback for each letter in the guess:\\n{\\\"index\\\": 0, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"s\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 1, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"t\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 2, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"a\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 3, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"r\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": true}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 4, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"t\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"[5 remaining attempts] Provide your guess:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"```\\nAnswer:::\\nExplanation: The letter \\\"r\\\" is in the word, but not in the fourth position.

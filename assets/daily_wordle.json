The letter \\\"e\\\" at index 2 is in the word but not in the correct position, so \\\"e\\\" must be in either index 1 or 4. The letters \\\"w\\\", \\\"p\\\", \\\"t\\\", \\\"h\\\", \\\"o\\\", \\\"m\\\", \\\"i\\\", \\\"l\\\", \\\"a\\\", \\\"r\\\", and \\\"d\\\" are not in the word.

The second letter \\\"e\\\" is in the word, but not in the correct position. Notice that the letter \\\"e\\\" appears twice in the guess, but only one of them is marked as in the word.

Invalid guesses include non-valid English words, words that don't have exactly 5 characters, or incorrect output format. If you make too many invalid/incorrect guesses, the game will end prematurely. Therefore, you need to be careful to respect the instructions and provide valid guesses in the correct format to maximize your chances of guessing the target word within the 6 valid attempts allowed.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"[6 remaining attempts] Provide your guess:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"```\\nAnswer:::\\nExplanation: I will start with a common five-letter word to gather some broad feedback on letters.

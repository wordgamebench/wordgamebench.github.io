Invalid guesses include non-valid English words, words that don't have exactly 5 characters, or incorrect output format. If you make too many invalid/incorrect guesses, the game will end prematurely. Therefore, you need to be careful to respect the instructions and provide valid guesses in the correct format to maximize your chances of guessing the target word within the 6 valid attempts allowed.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"[6 remaining attempts] Provide your guess:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"```\\nAnswer:::\\nExplanation: Starting with a common five-letter word to gather feedback on widely used letters. \\nGuess: t e a m s\\n```\", \"refusal\": \"\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"You guessed: teams\\nFollowing is feedback for each letter in the guess:\\n{\\\"index\\\": 0, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"t\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 1, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"e\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 2, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"a\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 3, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"m\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 4, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"s\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"[5 remaining attempts] Provide your guess:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"```\\nAnswer:::\\nExplanation: None of the letters from the previous guess \\\"teams\\\" are in the word, so I will choose a completely different set of letters to maximize my chances of finding the correct word.\\nGuess: b l o c k\\n```\", \"refusal\": \"\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"You guessed: block\\nFollowing is feedback for each letter in the guess:\\n{\\\"index\\\": 0, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"b\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 1, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"l\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": true, \\\"is_in_word\\\": true}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 2, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"o\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": true, \\\"is_in_word\\\": true}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 3, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"c\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 4, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"k\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"[4 remaining attempts] Provide your guess:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"```\\nAnswer:::\\nExplanation: The letters \\\"l\\\" and \\\"o\\\" are confirmed to be in the correct positions (1st and 2nd respectively).

Invalid guesses include non-valid English words, words that don't have exactly 5 characters, or incorrect output format. If you make too many invalid/incorrect guesses, the game will end prematurely. Therefore, you need to be careful to respect the instructions and provide valid guesses in the correct format to maximize your chances of guessing the target word within the 6 valid attempts allowed.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"[6 remaining attempts] Provide your guess:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"```\\nAnswer:::\\nExplanation: Starting with a common five-letter word to maximize information from the feedback. \\nGuess: p l a n e\\n```\", \"refusal\": \"\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"You guessed: plane\\nFollowing is feedback for each letter in the guess:\\n{\\\"index\\\": 0, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"p\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 1, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"l\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 2, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"a\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 3, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"n\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 4, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"e\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"[5 remaining attempts] Provide your guess:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"```\\nAnswer:::\\nExplanation: None of the letters in \\\"plane\\\" are in the word, so I will try a completely different five-letter word to gather new information.\\nGuess: t r a i n\\n```\", \"refusal\": \"\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"You guessed: train\\nFollowing is feedback for each letter in the guess:\\n{\\\"index\\\": 0, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"t\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": true}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 1, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"r\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 2, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"a\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 3, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"i\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": true, \\\"is_in_word\\\": true}\\n{\\\"index\\\": 4, \\\"letter\\\": \\\"n\\\", \\\"is_in_correct_position\\\": false, \\\"is_in_word\\\": false}\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"[4 remaining attempts] Provide your guess:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"```\\nAnswer:::\\nExplanation: The letters \\\"t\\\" and \\\"i\\\" are in the word, with \\\"i\\\" in the correct position.

The second letter \\\"e\\\" is in the word, but not in the correct position. Notice that the letter \\\"e\\\" appears twice in the guess, but only one of them is marked as in the word.

Invalid guesses include non-valid English words, words that don't have exactly 5 characters, or incorrect output format. If you make too many invalid/incorrect guesses, the game will end prematurely.
